              The idea is this: campus sellers believe students to be having a lot of money and are most of the time reluctant to reduce the price of the things they sell. With electronic gadgets, sellers would mention strange specifications of systems all with the aim of wooing the buyer, which works mostly in the case of women and some un-electronic guys. After some research, I realized that these same gadgets are available outside the campus at even cheaper prices than what is available in the system. 
              On some websites, you can get computers and other electronic gadgets far cheaper than it would cost to buy from these campus sellers with some people offering discount sales on high-spec electronic gadgets. 
              It is very interesting to note that most students though in need of such gadgets feel reluctant buying from these campus sellers. It is also inevitable that some once in a while, you can’t do without buying from them.

                   With all the setup completed, I would search online for some shops outside the school or even overseas offering discount sales on their gadgets, buy from them and then notify my representatives about the availability of the gadgets. With a bit of reduced sales, I know it would be easier to get a buyer and get some profit. I hope to expand this idea to other universities in Ghana and with time (after school), I would just order and be doing the sales through my representatives or better still have my own website and have some sort of money cards at sale points which when purchased can be used to buy gadgets from the website. I also intended on providing services like door-to-door delivery and servicing of these gadgets whether or not it was sold by us which could also lead to more revenue.
